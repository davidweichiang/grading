These are some scripts to make grading assignments with Sakai easier.

Requirements:

- Python 2.7 (3 probably doesn't work, but it would be easy to make it work)
- BeautifulSoup 4 (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- Sakai 10.5: The scripts are designed around some idiosyncrasies in Sakai that might be absent in earlier or later versions.

See `collect.py` and `return.py` for examples.
